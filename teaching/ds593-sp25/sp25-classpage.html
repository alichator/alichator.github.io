              While the Snowden revelations a decade ago brought privacy concerns to the mainstream, recent developments from across society such as generative AI, GDPR/CCPA, and the Dobbs decision have brought questions about data privacy, consent, management front and center. At the same time it can be hard to navigate how to think about privacy, protect it, and build for it. This class is an introduction to privacy in practice, intending to give students an understanding of modern frameworks for privacy and various privacy-enhancing technologies and mechanisms, as well as a hands-on exploration of relevant existing technologies in practice. Students will be encouraged to think critically about their relationships to their data and the consequences of different consent, protection, and management mechanisms-both for themselves and for society as a whole. This class is targeted for all audiences, and hopes to provide conceptual tools around privacy that would be valuable regardless of setting.
